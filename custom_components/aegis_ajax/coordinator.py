# SpaceControl holds `0x04` at `80` the same way (#339, 244 consecutive
# readings) — caught there only because `80` is not one of the two values the
# routing acts on. So the routing is limited to the families where a capture
# tied a key to a *physical* tamper, both from #339: a MotionProtect Curtain
# flipping both keys `00` -> `01` on being pulled off its SmartBracket and

#
# Widen this per family, on a capture showing a key move with a physical

# Per-device *measurements* carried across a full device snapshot that omits
# them (#403). `_handle_devices_snapshot` rebuilds each device from the snapshot,
# so a reading the stream does not repeat is gone until that device next sends
# one — and a battery sitting at 100% has nothing to send, which is why it is the
# reading that never comes back. @wip3out3r measured 1 of 13 batteries and 1 of
# 11 signal strengths still empty four hours later, while the only two devices
# that already had a carry-forward kept their values throughout. That contrast is
# what identified this function rather than the HTS disconnect handler, which
# preserves its caches by design.
#
# Named, rather than a blanket "merge instead of replace", because most of what
# rides in `statuses` must NOT survive a snapshot: `lid_opened`, `case_drilling`
# and `gsm_connected` are operational alerts, and an alert that has cleared has
# to clear here too. Membership follows the rule the report states better than we
# had: a snapshot omitting a *measurement* does not make the previous value
# wrong, only older. Anything whose absence is itself the signal stays out.
#
# `temperature` was excluded here at first and #403 stayed open for it: the
# worry was that a carry would leave a family with no per-device temperature
# source holding one. It cannot — this pass only fills a key already present in
# the existing statuses, so a device that never reported a temperature never
# gains one (pinned by
# `test_snapshot_does_not_invent_temperature_the_device_never_reported`). The
# staleness/immortality risk is exactly the one already accepted for the four
# keys above: a carried value is overwritten by the next row that reports one,
# and seven of the nine temperatures that emptied in #403 were light-stream
# families no siren-gated carry could reach. For the
# `HUB_DEVICE_TEMPERATURE_DEVICE_TYPES` families the value arrives from a
# separate per-device RPC (#220, #229), so EVERY light snapshot omits it — for
# them this carry is what keeps the sensor valued between timer fires, a job a
# siren-gated block used to do before this entry subsumed it.
#
# `tamper` and the siren settings keep their own blocks below — they carry
# provenance conditions this generic pass has no business reproducing.
# HTS per-device key carrying a MultiTransmitter wire input's contact state

# applies the input's configured NO/NC polarity ITSELF before reporting, so
# `01` (CONTACT_DISRUPTED — the app's "Alerte") always means "the contact
# left its configured rest position" in both modes, and `00`/`02` mean at
# rest ("OK"). It rides the STATUS_BODY the client already requests every
# 60 s plus live STATUS_UPDATE deltas — consuming it adds no Ajax API
# traffic. STRICTLY per-family: the same byte is

# A hardware log of an Ajax Button in control mode showed `0x39` on the
# device's STATUS_UPDATE row moving to the exact second of each press, twice,
# on two independent presses: a press logged at 08:18:25 local carried
# `0x39=6a683b9f` (05:18:23Z) and one at 08:23:10 carried `0x39=6a683cbd`
# (05:23:09Z) on a UTC+3 install. So `0x39` decodes as a big-endian Unix epoch
# and it is the only signal a control-mode press produces at all — the
# `button_1_on` / `button_2_on` FCM tags never appeared, and the coincident
# gRPC delta is a plain `battery` status.
#
# Two things that capture could NOT establish, which is why this is a probe and
# not an event entity:
#
#   1. **Short vs long click are indistinguishable in it.** Both presses moved
#      `0x39` and nothing else; `0x40` stayed `00000000` on that device. So a
#      one-key signal cannot carry the two separate actions the issue asks for.
#      (`0x40` did hold an old epoch — 2026-07-03 — on the install's *other*
#      Button, so it means something rarer than a press, not the second action.)
#   2. **Whether it moves without a press.** Ajax peripherals ping the hub for
#      supervision, and if `0x39` were last-radio-contact rather than
#      last-press, routing an HA event off it would fire phantom presses on
#      every ping. Logging only *transitions* makes an idle install the control

        along so a capture shows whether the row's shape moved, without

        the bytes are fresh from the row, while `deactivated=`/`kinds=` come

          something else on this firmware and we want no part of it.
        - **Time must move forward.** An equal value is the snapshot repeating
          itself; a lower one is not something a press can produce, so treat it
          as a new baseline rather than an event.

        Deliberately consumes both snapshot and delta rows. The deltas catch
        every individual press, while the snapshot samples once a minute and
        collapses a burst to its last value — so a delta the client missed can
        still surface via the snapshot, at the cost of a slightly older
        timestamp. Both paths share one cache, so whichever arrives first fires
        and the other sees no change.

        `0x33=00` is "left its rest position" — the app's "Alerte" — and maps
        to open; `0x33=01` is at rest ("OK") and maps to closed. The proto
        enum (CONTACT_DISRUPTED=1, CONTACT_NORMAL=2) does NOT describe this
        byte: firmware sends a bool whose values contradict the enum's names,
        and reading `01` as "disrupted" is the inversion both field reports
        saw on 1.17.1-beta.4/5 (a closed NC door showed "open"). Anything but
        `00`/`01` — the enum's `02`/`03`, whose names are no longer evidence,
        and the `80` sentinel the hub bursts on a settings write — says
        nothing about the contact's position and leaves the stored state
        untouched.

        ⚠️ **The hub applies the input's NO/NC polarity before reporting, so
        do NOT add polarity handling here.** Settled by Taknok's four-state
        capture with 2-minute dwells (2026-08-25, `1.17.1-beta.6`):

            NC + circuit open   -> 00    NO + circuit closed -> 00
            NC + circuit closed -> 01    NO + circuit open   -> 01

        Both modes agree on the *meaning*: `00` whenever the wire is away
        from the position the configured mode calls rest. Since NO/NC is
        chosen so the loop sits at rest with the door shut, `00` is always
        "door open" and the sensor reads correctly in both wirings.

        The same capture identified `0x4A` on the input's SETTINGS object as
        the NO/NC mode itself (`01` = NC, `00` = NO). Deliberately unused:
        XOR-ing it into `0x33` would recover the RAW circuit state, which
        inverts against the door on NO wiring — the opposite of what an
        `opening` sensor should say. Guarded by
        `test_the_no_nc_mode_key_is_not_consumed`.

        Family-gated hard to `wire_input_mt`: the same byte means
        `external_sensor_power_broken` on the MultiTransmitter itself and
        other things on other families (#406's lesson). Re-reads the device
        from `self.devices` because an earlier applier in the kv chain may
